# Cryptocurrencies

Analysis Overview

In this project, we are using unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies. We want to generate a traded cryptocurrencies classified.
The classification report needs to use an investment bank to offer a new cryptocurrency investment group for the clients. 
Results
After cleaning and process of data we get 532 tradeable cryptocurrencies. 

Then we used K-Means to determine the clusters of the cryptocurrencies. We ran elbow curve using K-Means method to determine the K value. We found K value as 4.

Summary

Using methods of machine learning such as unsupervised machine learning, PCA algorithm and K-Means, we conclude that this model has the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features.
